//*****************************************************
//Default Methods and Static Methods (Java 8+): Starting from Java 8, interfaces can contain default methods,
//which provide a default implementation for a method. Interfaces can also have static methods, 
//which are similar to static methods in classes but are declared in the interface and cannot be overridden by implementing classes.
